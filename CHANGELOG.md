# Changelog

Every tag has one entry: version, date, MAJOR | MINOR | PATCH, the instruments affected, and
"rates comparable: yes | no" (for a MAJOR, the fixture recall before and after).

## Unreleased

(nothing yet)

## 1.0.0-rc.1 — 2026-09-09

The first release candidate: MAJOR (the first). Instruments affected: all four, first issue. Rates
comparable: no (no earlier version).

- The package as `IMPLEMENTATION.md` Phase 1 states it: the CLI (`gbg <noun> <verb>`, every verb of the
  closed table), the config and its schema with the eighteen artefact schemas, the policy layer with
  `RULES.toml`, the templates and `sync`, `init` with the baseline and seed migration, the doctor's
  full check table, the text-scan engine with the 39 catalogued scans, the Documenter wrapper and the
  built-HTML scans, the test harness, the witness runner, the four instruments' protocols, catalogues
  and Workflow scripts, and the round machinery (preflight, prepare, bank, pass open, grade, close,
  abandon) with the seeds, recall and demotion engines.
- The tool is its own fifth consumer: its `.gbg/`, its managed files, its site through its own wrapper,
  its tests ending in `TestHarness.gate()`.
- The fixture `fixture/GBG Fixture/` with its defects corpus (42 planted classes, 20 clean twins), and
  the self-test suite over it.
- Revision 9 of the architecture: Workflow payloads are files, args carry paths.
- Nothing pins this tag; it exists so the tool's first `/check-docs` round over its own docs opens at
  a clean tag.


- Phase 1 in progress: the skeleton, the CLI, the ports (see `IMPLEMENTATION.md`).
- 1.6 consolidator acceptance (2026-09-09): `Consolidate.jl` over Gumbo produced byte-equal
  `manuscript-{full,siteonly}.md` pairs against the consumers' `consolidate.py` on PF's build (18 pages,
  1 093 435 / 410 836 chars) and IT's (22 pages, 555 623 / 484 749 chars); the Python is gone. Two
  BeautifulSoup behaviours had to be mirrored: whitespace-only text nodes are kept (Gumbo.jl drops them
  by default) and collapsed to one space, or one newline when they contain one.
- Pre-migration scan census (2026-09-09, the tool's scans run read-only over the two consumers with
  their §5 configs; no ledger yet, so every count is before adjudication — what Phases 4 and 5 will
  meet). PF hard: THIN_SPACE 3, MATHBF 23 (`\mathbf 1` unbraced, `\mathbf{k}` in the generated example
  page — now a `generated` glob in §5.1), LEFTRIGHT 1, FIELD_DOCS 3 (the `NO_FIELD_LIST` trio →
  ledger), PROSE_SHAPE 42 docstrings over the 120-word cap + 8 heading-order, AI_BANNER 1
  (`examples/gpu/rocm/HIST_ROCm.jl`); PF triage: FORMULA_IN_BACKTICKS 9, CODE_IN_MATH 3,
  CITATION_CRAMMED 1, SENTENCE_OPENER 3 (identical to `sentence_openers.py`), SIGNATURE_WIDE 3,
  ABUTTING_SPANS 137 (PF's `` `name` ``\equiv …`` `` notation idiom). IT hard: NEG_THIN_BIGL 11
  (`\exp\!\bigl(`), REF_ABUT_CODE 20 (`[`f`](@ref)`(args)``), FIELD_DOCS 39 (no `The fields are`
  lists), LINK_UNIFORMITY 1, API_PAGE_STRUCTURE 1 (`@index`), AI_BANNER 1 (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`),
  DOI_CROSSCHECK 26 (all in the `Phenomenology` leaf IT exempts → ledger glob); IT triage:
  SENTENCE_OPENER 8, ABUTTING_SPANS 10, CODE_IN_MATH 4, the stale-variable custom scan 192 before
  IT's exclusion filter. `gbg init` writes each consumer's `docs/prose_shape.csv` afresh (PF's existing
  file keys its units the same way but counted fenced code and in-fence `#` lines).
- Deferred (recorded, not planned): a private Julia registry as the upgrade of the pin syntax; Julia
  1.12 workspaces to collapse the sub-environment entries; `.claude/rules/` as an alternative policy
  placement; IT's rubric-audit calibration triple as an optional instrument with a verb of its own.
